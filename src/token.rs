//! Token types for lexical analysis.
//!
//! This module defines the types used during tokenization (lexical analysis)
//! of EventQL queries. Tokens are the atomic units produced by the lexer
//! and consumed by the parser.
//!
//! # Core Types
//!
//! - [`Token`] - A token with position information
//! - [`Sym`] - The symbol/category of a token
//! - [`Operator`] - Arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators
//! - [`Symbol`] - Structural symbols (parentheses, brackets, etc.)
