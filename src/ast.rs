//! Abstract syntax tree (AST) types for EventQL.
//!
//! This module defines the structure of parsed EventQL queries as an abstract
//! syntax tree. The AST represents the semantic structure of a query, making it
//! easy to analyze, transform, or execute queries.
//!
//! # Core Types
//!
//! - [`Query`] - The root of the AST, representing a complete query
//! - [`Expr`] - Expressions with position and type information
//! - [`Value`] - The various kinds of expression values (literals, operators, etc.)
//! - [`Source`] - Data sources in FROM clauses
//!
